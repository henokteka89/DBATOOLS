Step 1: Setup Distributor and Publisher (on the sender end)
#-- In most cases distributor and publisher is a same server, but if high throughput is required, you can offload distributor to another server. Here Both are the same server. 
# -- Enable-DbaReplDistributor and Enable-DbaReplPublishing
 
  # A. Configure a server a distributor 
Enable-DbaReplDistributor -SqlInstance abc  #This creates the "distribution" database

  # B. Configure a server a Publisher 
Enable-DbaReplPublishing -SqlInstance abc

# -- All is set to create publications, articles and subscriptions. The focus here is Transactional Replication

  Step 2: Create Publication and Article 
    
# A. Create a transactional publication (New-DbaReplPublication) 
# (My server is hek, the database for publication is stackoverflow2013, the name of the publication is HekStPub, the type is transactional replication)
$addpublication = @{
    SqlInstance = 'hek'
    Database    = 'Stackoverflow2013'
    Name        = 'HekStPub'
    Type        = 'Transactional'
}
New-DbaReplPublication @addpublication


# B. Create an Article next Add-DbaReplArticle
  $addarticle = @{
    SqlInstance = 'hek'
    Database    = 'Stackoverflow2013'
    Publication = 'HekStPub'
    Schema      = 'dbo'
    Name        = 'Posts'
    Filter      = "CreationDate >= '2012.12.12'"  #Filters the table and publishes only those after this date. Filter can be ignored. 
    }
Add-DbaReplArticle @addarticle

Step 3. Add a Subsctiption on the reciepient end  

#  Add a Subscription (New-DbaReplSubscription)
# My server is hek2, the publication name and database name are created above in hek server (HekStPub and Stackoverflow2013)
  # It is better to create the database ahead of time (recommended). If it is not created, dbatool will handle that.
$subcription = @{
    SqlInstance           = 'hek'
    Database              = 'Stackoverflow2013'
    SubscriberSqlInstance = 'hek2'
    SubscriptionDatabase  = 'Stackoverflow2013'
    PublicationName       = 'HekStPub'
    Type                  = 'Push'
}
New-DbaReplSubscription @subcription
# To confirm if the subscription is created as expected use Get-DbaReplSubscription -SqlInstance hek.

Step 4. Finalizing ..Run the Snapshot Agent..back to the sender server
  #At this point all agent jobs are created. 
  
  #If this is the only repl-snapshot run the below
Get-DbaAgentJob -SqlInstance sql1 -Category repl-snapshot | Start-DbaAgentJob
  
  #If there are multiple publications, modify -Category with the proper name or manually run the snapshot job (HekStPub-...)

# Keep testing by inserting new values.
