Step 1: Setup Distributor and Publisher (on the sender end)
#-- In most cases, the distributor and publisher are the same server, but if high throughput is required, you can offload the distributor to another server. Here Both are on the same server. 
# -- Enable-DbaReplDistributor and Enable-DbaReplPublishing
 
  # A. Configure a server for a distributor 
Enable-DbaReplDistributor -SqlInstance ABC  #This creates the "distribution" database

  # B. Configure a server a Publisher 
Enable-DbaReplPublishing -SqlInstance ABC

# -- All is set to create publications, articles, and subscriptions. The focus here is Transactional Replication

  Step 2: Create Publication and Article 
    
# A. Create a transactional publication (New-DbaReplPublication) 
# (My server is hek, the database for publication is stackoverflow2013, the name of the publication is HekStPub, the type is transactional replication)
$addpublication = @{
    SqlInstance = 'hek'
    Database    = 'Stackoverflow2013'
    Name        = 'HekStPub'
    Type        = 'Transactional'
}
New-DbaReplPublication @addpublication


# B. Create an Article next Add-DbaReplArticle
  $addarticle = @{
    SqlInstance = 'hek'
    Database    = 'Stackoverflow2013'
    Publication = 'HekStPub'
    Schema      = 'dbo'
    Name        = 'Posts'
    Filter      = "CreationDate >= '2012.12.12'"  #Filters the table and publishes only those after this date. Filter can be ignored. 
    }
Add-DbaReplArticle @addarticle

Step 3. Add a Subsctiption on the reciepient end  

#  Add a Subscription (New-DbaReplSubscription)
# My server is hek2, the publication name and database name are created above in hek server (HekStPub and Stackoverflow2013)
  # It is better to create the database ahead of time (recommended). If it is not created, dbatool will handle that.
$subscription = @{
    SqlInstance           = 'hek'
    Database              = 'Stackoverflow2013'
    SubscriberSqlInstance = 'hek2'
    SubscriptionDatabase  = 'Stackoverflow2013'
    PublicationName       = 'HekStPub'
    Type                  = 'Push'
}
New-DbaReplSubscription @subscription
# To confirm if the subscription is created as expected use Get-DbaReplSubscription -SqlInstance hek.

Step 4. Finalizing ..Run the Snapshot Agent..back to the sender server
  #At this point all agent jobs are created. 
  
  #If this is the only repl-snapshot run the below
# Get-DbaAgentJob -SqlInstance sql1 -Category repl-snapshot | Start-DbaAgentJob
  
  #If there are multiple publications, modify -Category with the proper name or manually run the snapshot job (servername-databasename-publicationname-#-...)

# Keep testing by inserting new values. 
  
# Delete or Disables replication distribution for the target SQL instances (CAUTION NEEDED THIS WILL DESTROY ALL PUBLICATION, Subscription etc)
# Disable-DbaReplPublishing -SqlInstance hek
